# ðŸ¤– Self-organization of Robots in a Hostile Environment  

This project simulates the mission of autonomous robots tasked with collecting, transforming, and transporting hazardous waste in a radioactive environment. The robots operate in three distinct zones, each with varying levels of radioactivity, and each robot type has specific capabilities and restrictions. This simulation uses a multi-agent system (MAS) to model collaborative behavior in a hostile environment.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a multi-agent system where robots cooperate to clean hazardous waste in a radioactive environment. The environment is divided into three zones based on radioactivity levels, and each type of robot has specialized tasks within these zones:

### **Zones:**

1. **Zone 1 (Low Radioactivity):** Contains green waste, accessible only to **Green Robots**.
2. **Zone 2 (Medium Radioactivity):** Contains yellow waste, accessible to **Yellow** and **Red Robots**.
3. **Zone 3 (High Radioactivity):** A storage area for fully processed waste, accessible only to **Red Robots**.

### **Key Features:**

- **Robot Types:**  
  - **Green Robots:** Collect and transform green waste into yellow waste.  
  - **Yellow Robots:** Collect and transform yellow waste into red waste.  
  - **Red Robots:** Transport red waste to the disposal zone.  

- **Agent Behaviors:**  
  - Perception, deliberation, and action cycles for autonomous decision-making.  
  - Communication capabilities between robots for improved collaboration (this will be added in future steps).  

- **Visualization:**  
  - Real-time simulation with an interactive visualization to observe robot behaviors and waste processing in action.


## Structure

  - `agents.py`: Agents implementation.
  - `model.py`: Environment implementation.
  - `objects.py`: Objects implementation as inactive agents (waste/radioactivity cells...)
  - `server.py`: Contains all the necessary for running the visualisation.
  - `run.py`: Handles the launch of the simulation.

## Prerequisites  

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:  

- **Python 3.11+**  
- **Required Libraries:** You will find the required packages in the [requirements.txt](#requirements.txt) file.


## Usage  

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Malek14032000/Projet_SMA.git
    cd Projet_SMA
    ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

4. Visualisation: 
Once the simulation starts, a browser-based visualization will automatically open to allow you to observe the robots' activities in real-time.
